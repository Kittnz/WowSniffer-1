# WowSniffer
WARNING - Since the build 7.3 it is no longer safe to use memory injecting sniffers, because the memory has to be remaped in order to be written, which I do not recommend doing, it is highly likely you will get banned on the live servers
We will have to roll back to the days of netowrk sniffers with session-key memreading <- not that hard, might code later one, no time RN due to university
